Exercise 1-11:
How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

ANS:
-Words that extend onto two lines
-use not standard ASCII input
-use different languages
-run through multiple sources of input

Way to catch errors
-run it so that each word is output on a singe line and check those against words in that language
